<h1>SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation</h1>
Every year in the world, 3.6 billion people do not have access to water, 5 million people die from dehydration, and 1.8 billion 
homes still do not have safe water to drink. Water scarcity is not a new problem anymore. It has been a problem that has been 
affecting us globally since the 1800s. That is at least two centuries of everyone not having clean water to drink. This 
presentation will show you how to fix problem that had changed the world for a long time.<br><br><br>

<h2>The Significance</h2>
Ensure access to water and sanitation for all. Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is the most basic human need for 
health and well-being.
<h2>Targets</h2>
6.1 - Safe and affordable drinking water.<br>
6.2 - End open defecation and provide access to sanitation and hygiene.<br>
6.3 - Improve water quality wastewater treatment and safe reuse.<br>
6.4 - Increase water-use effeciency and ensure freshwater supplies.<br>
6.5 - Implemented intergrated water resources management.<br>
6.6 - Protect and restore water related ecosystems.<br>
6.7 - Expand water sanitation support to developing countries.<br>
6.8 - Support local engagement in water and sanitation management.<br>
<h2>Global Status</h2>
The United Nations concluded that even until today, the world is still far from achieving this goal. As of 2024, there are
still only a few countries like Andorra and Monaco have acheived this goal. However, most countries in the world still face
challenges regarding about this goal.<br><br><br>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
1. Infrastructure - Buidling sanitary infrastructure is a critical step in achieving SDG 6.<br>
2. International cooperation - International cooperation remains a big problem in achieving SDG 6.<br>
3. Policies - This underlies an uneven field in knowledge exhanging and cooperation.<br>
4. Funding inequality - Funding often disproportionately favours urban areas and leave behind rural areas.<br>
<h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
1. Adapting pre-existing techniques and enhancing them for better usage.<br>
In regions that have a fine water supply, storing water for long-term use is an essential requirement. Due to the lack of
resources, a natural well, comprised of dirt, is commonly used. But the problem lies within the porous nature of dirt, as it 
may pollute the minerals present in clean water. To combat this, the well structure should be modified to have a non-porous lid,
and the water should be housed in a metal or non-porous structure. In doing so, this will enhance the shelf life of water, and 
provide safe, drinking water for the wider community.<br><br>
2. Further emphasis on sanitary practices.<br>
It should be noted that public defecation is still a large hinderance towards accessibility to clean water, as 6.3%, or 494 
million people still partake in this. This is heavily prevalent in rural communities. As there are no toilet facilities, 
defecation may be deposited in areas close to water supplies and sources, thus polluting the drinking water and render the 
community at risk of infections. Recently, there has been an immense push in the eradication of public defecation. In this case,
the solution is far more complex than merely building toilet facilities. Rather, it would be more realistic to designate water 
supply regions as zones for no defecation. Further education of the risks associated with public defecation should also be 
implemented. Therefore, it is essential to remember that differing regions of the globe are equipped with diverse resources. 
Adapting pre-existing techniques of water preservation and storage may reap benefits for underprivileged communities, and 
ultimately enable the UN to achieve its goals of accessibility to safe water sources and sanitation for all.<br><br>
